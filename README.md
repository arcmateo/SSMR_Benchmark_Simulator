# A Benchmark Simulator for Advanced Control of Ethanol Steam Reforming
This repository contains the benchmark simulator for a staged-separation membrane reactor (SSMR) designed for pure hydrogen production. The simulator implements a nonlinear dynamic model of a two-stage process: ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and hydrogen separation. It is intended as a benchmark for testing control and estimation strategies.
